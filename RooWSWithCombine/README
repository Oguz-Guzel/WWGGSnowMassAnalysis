After the combine setup (tried in CMSSW_10_X setup), in src: 
1. have this directory copied. 
2. Do : 
>  ./runAll.sh outputdir_from_produceDataCards.py output_store_dir <username(sjain/sdonerta depending on who ran previous step)> 

This runs the conversions, fits, combines the datacards and gives the results in output_store_dir

Then in fit dir: the ipynb files runs the final fit plots to be put in paper. Two version with/without ratio plots are there.
